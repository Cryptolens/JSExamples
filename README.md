#JSON.Template
The purpose of these methods is to make it easier to set up a custom "Thank you" page in SKM Payment Forms (https://serialkeymanager.com/Feature/PaymentForm).

##Getting started
The primary method that should be used is _MultipleJSONArrays_, since the _res_ value sent to your page will be of that format.
Please ensure that the json parameter is already converted into JSON.
